A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/terryoshea/pen/BLaXYQ.

Free Code Camp's 'Show National Contiguity with a Force Directed Map' Project (for Data Visualization Certificate). Built with D3. 

The CodePen version uses SCSS; here itâ€™s transmogrified into plain CSS. 

A sprite is used for quicker downloads, but it makes the CSS very long. Oh well.
